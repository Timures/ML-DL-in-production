# Streamlit example

Streamlit example with Docker

Streamlit is a quick way to create a data application

Let's say you need to quickly create a data application. It can include a dashboard and work with a model. Or if you need a quick prototype to show to a customer, which can be done in a few hours and for free.

Streamlit is perfect for these tasks. Everything is pure Python. You will only need to master the interactive components to create filters / checkboxes / input / upload fields.
Let's analyze the functionality using the already familiar example of Fisher's Irises. Let's make a very simple dashboard with the choice of the type of irises and the construction of histograms. Also in Streamlit you can train and make inference models.
